JGum
====

JGum is a small Java library providing a customizable mechanism for adding and querying properties from hierarchical Java meta-objects (e.g., classes and packages).

In case you would like to know more about it, you may find interesting the short [tutorial](http://jgum.github.com/tutorial/ "JGum Tutorial") 
and [API](http://jgum.github.com/apidocs/ "API documentation ") documentation.
You can also [send me an email](mailto:sergio.castro@uclouvain.be), I will be happy to know about you !
