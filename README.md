JGum
====

JGum is a lightweight categorization framework for Java.
It provides high-level support for creating and managing different kinds of category hierarchies (e.g., named and type hierarchies), as well as a simple API for querying and manipulating the properties of hierarchical categories.

Its code was factored out from other projects of the author in the hope that it may help other people dealing with similar categorization problems.

In case you would like to know more about it, you may find interesting the [API](http://jgum.github.com/apidocs/ "API documentation ") documentation.
