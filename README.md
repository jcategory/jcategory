JGum
====

JGum is a lightweight categorization framework for Java.
It provides support for creating custom hierarchical categories and for modelling Java categorization artifacts (e.g., hierarchical meta-objects such as classes and packages).

JGum also provides a simple API for adding and querying category properties and for visiting different categories according to a traversal strategy.

Its code was factored out from other projects of the author in the hope that it may help other people dealing with similar categorization problems.

In case you would like to know more about it, you may find interesting the [API](http://jgum.github.com/apidocs/ "API documentation ") documentation.
